npx create-react-app [AppName] -> create project
npm install -> install dependencies from packages.json
npm start -> serve website
Components -> Functions named with a capital letter at the start that return JSX
Dynamic Content -> Variables in {} inside the JSX
Links -> By default relative, use "https://" to make them absolute (go to other sites)
Style -> Can be assigned dynamically via a JS object
Pass arguments on event handlers -> The handler must me an anonymous function with on arguments that calls a function that has arguments
Event object -> Only the event handler with no arguments gets it
State -> [referenceToStateVariable, functionToChange] = useState(initialValueOfAnyType)
Specifing list items -> Use key property in JSX to reference items created iteratively
Props -> A way to pass arguments from a parent to a child element. Pass the data as a property to the child element from the parent JSX and receive it on the child component from the props argument
array.map (ngFor*) -> Give a function as an argument that takes as an argument an array element and outputs something in relation to that element (create a new array of elements)
array.filter -> Give a function as an argument that takes as an argument an array element and outputs true or false in relation to that element (limit the elements in the array)
Changing state in a different element ->  If you want an element to change the state defined in a parent element, it should be given the state updating function as a prop
If you change the state in one element all the element that use it are affected
useEffect() -> Take as an argument a function that should be call each time an element renders (state changes) e.g. can be used to communicate with a server
useEffect Dependencies -> The useEffect function takes as a second argument an array of state variable whose change invokes the function given in the first argument
avoid useEffect-setState infinate loop -> The state you are setting must not be a dependency of the useEffect
initialState -> Set the initial state in useState to be of the value you expect to set it
JSX -> It's not exactly returned to be rendered once its evaluated it is rendered
conditionalTemplates (ngIf*) -> {condition && JSX}
conditionalTemplates (ngIf* else) -> You can use a ternary expression to show different templates according to a condition e.g. (condition) ? JSX1 : JSX2
sleep -> setTimeout(functionToRun, timeInMs)
FetchAPI -> When fetching a resource you need two then callbacks e.g. fetch(url).then(res => res.json()).then(data=>data).catch(err=>console.log(err.message))
Fetch Errors -> The catch callback also responds to the Errors thrown inside the then functions
json-server -> npx json-server --watch <json file location> --port <port>
Routing -> Everything is incased in the <BrowserRouter> tag. The part you want to change as the pages change is the <Switch> tag and in contains <Route> tags
Sticky elements -> If you want an element to be present in every page (NavBar) you can put in outside the <Switch> tag
Link -> Use the <Link> tag instead of the <a> tag in order for react to intercept the request to the server. The <Link> tag has a to="" property instead of a href=""
Router v5 -> Can match parsial urls to paths so use the property exact
Unmounted component fetch -> If there is an async function, that changes the state, running on a component which unmounts (the page changes) then there is an error
Aborting Fetch -> You can link a AbortController to a fetch request to be able to stop it before it finished
