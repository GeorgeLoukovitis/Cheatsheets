Structure -> MongoDB is a NoSQL database, meaning that it has collections which contain documents instead of tables. Documents are structured like JSON files. 1 collection per table 1 document per record
Nested Documents -> A document can have a property which is also a document or an array of documents
Turn Service On/Off -> Type Services on the Windows search bar, open the app and find the MongoDB service
----------- MongoDB Shell -----------------
Select Database -> use databaseName (the database doesn't need to already exist)
Show Databases -> show dbs
Show Collections of the selected database -> show collections
Reference Database -> The selected database is stored in the variable db
Printing variables -> You can print a variable by typing it's name
Add a document -> Collection.insertOne(documentAsObject) (if the collection doesn't already exists it's gonna be created)
Add many documents -> Collection.insertMany(arrayOfDocumentsAsObjects) (if the collection doesn't already exists it's gonna be created)
Show collection -> Collection.find() (first 20 - there is also the findOne variant) 
Filter output -> Collection.find({ field1: value1, field2: value2 })
Select specific fields of the filtered output -> Collection.find({ field1: value1, field2: value2 }, { field1: 1, field2: 1 }) (give an object mapping wanted fields to 1 as the second argument)
Collection.find() return type -> Collection
Collection.findOne() return type -> Document
Count the documents of a collection -> Collection.count()
Limit the amount of documents in a collection -> Collection.limit(number)
Sort the documents of a collection -> Collection.sort({ fieldToOrderBy: 1 }) (Change 1 to -1 for DESC order)
